<p>The PubAPI is a read-only REST API that responds with JSON-LD data. Our goal is to re-package all currently public data from the website and make it available via the PubAPI. "Public Data" is information available to people who are not logged in, such as player data, game data, and club/tournament information. This excludes private information that is restricted to the logged in user, such as game chat and conditional moves.</p>
<p>This is read-only data. You cannot send game-moves or other commands to Chess.com from this system. If you wish to send commands, you will be interested in the Interactive API releasing later this year.</p>
<p>To use the PubAPI:</p>
<ol>
<li>determine the data you want, and compose the URL for it based on the endpoint URL pattern</li>
<li>request that URL in your browser, program, <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a>, cURL, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers">pigeon</a>.</li>
<li>enjoy the JSON <img src="https://www.chess.com/bundles/web/images/icons/smileys/1x/happy.png" srcset="https://www.chess.com/bundles/web/images/icons/smileys/2x/happy.png 2x" title="happy" /></li>
</ol>
<p>This page is the documentation for the PubAPI. We will edit this page to make corrections and add new documentation as the API grows. We will date these changes and report them in <a href="https://www.chess.com/clubs/forum/view/changelog">the CHANGELOG</a> so that you can tell what is fresh. Please keep the comments focused on the documentation itself, and use the <a href="https://www.chess.com/clubs/forum/chess-com-developer-community">Club Forums</a> to discuss suggestions, bug reports, and how you use the data!</p>

<h3>General Use Features and Issues</h3>
<p>The format for each endpoint will be different, and described in a release note about that endpoint. They all share the following features and issues. Even though you only need a URL to obtain the data, we advise that you read through and understand all of these before you start any significant work.</p>
<p><strong>Cache invalidation:</strong> This endpoints refresh at most once every 12 hours</p>
<p><a id="pubapi-general-current" name="pubapi-general-current"></a></p>
<h6>Not (Yet) Guaranteed Current</h6>
<p>About 3% of players are still actively using the old "v2" website for some actions. When these players perform an action that modifies the data you are requesting, the data may be out of date when we deliver it to you. We expect to remove the option of using v2 in the coming months. Until then, you can communicate to your users that data accuracy will be improved if they and their opponents are all using the new v3 website.</p>
<p>This issue does not apply to people using the mobile apps.</p>
<p><a id="pubapi-general-language" name="pubapi-general-language"></a></p>
<h6>English</h6>
<p>URL responses are the same for everyone, no matter who or where they are. This speeds up delivery, but also means that in cases where the data contain words (for example, reasons for game ending, error responses), these words will be in English.</p>
<p><a id="pubapi-general-rate-limits" name="pubapi-general-rate-limits"></a></p>
<h6>Rate Limiting</h6>
<p>Your serial access rate is unlimited. If you always wait to receive the response to your previous request before making your next request, then you should never encounter rate limiting.</p>
<p>However, if you make requests in parallel (for example, in a threaded application or a webserver handling multiple simultaneous requests), then some requests may be blocked depending on how much work it takes to fulfill your previous request. You should be prepared to accept a "<code>429 Too Many Requests</code>" response from our server for any non-serial request that you make.</p>
<p>In some cases, if we detect abnormal or suspicious activity, we may block your application entirely. If you supply a recognizable user-agent that contains contact information, then if we must block you application we will attempt to contact you to correct the problem.</p>
<p><a id="pubapi-clients" name="pubapi-clients"></a></p>
<h6>How to get the PubAPI data</h6>
<p>The PubAPI endpoints can be called, by any kind of client or browsers that supports the HTTP protocol.</p>
<p>So if you only want to see what happens when you issue a <i>request</i> to an endpoint you can open your browser and write in the address bar the endpoint you are interested in (for example the <a href="https://api.chess.com/pub/player/hikaru">Profile</a> endpoint.</p>
<p>The <i>response</i> is compressed, but there are many tools only that can render that response in a more readable format (gor example <a href="https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com</a>).</p>
<p>If you have access to a Command Prompt/Terminal Window you can use the <code>curl</code> command that will give you more useful information. <br />For example the command "<code>curl -v <a href="https://api.chess.com/pub/player/hikaru">https://api.chess.com/pub/player/hikaru</a></code>" will return, among with the response, a lot of useful data such as the <code>response code</code>, <code>Etag</code>, <code>date</code>, <code>last-modified</code> that are very useful to check if you are retrieving fresh or cached data.<br />If you want to play with cdata retrieved by <code>curl</code> you can use <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> as was shown in these brilliant <a href="https://www.chess.com/clubs/forum/view/my-firsts-tests-with-chess-com-api-some-examples-with-json-manipulations">examples</a> by @pmaugeri.</p>
<p>If you don't want to deal with command line there are many free tools online that provide an easier user interface. The ones that we use mostly in our team are <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a> and <a href="https://insomnia.rest">Insomnia</a>.</p>
<p>If you use Postman or Insomnia, <b>we have released a collection of endpoints</b> that you can download from <a href="https://www.chess.com/postman/collection-dev.json">HERE</a>. After installing the collection you will find all the current endpoints that you can call by a click (and analyze the response, convert the call into a language of your choice etc.) . If you need instructions on how import collections, check this <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/collections/data_formats">link</a> for Postman or this <a href="https://support.insomnia.rest/article/52-importing-and-exporting-data">link</a> for Insomnia.</p>
<p>All time fields are expressed as "timestamp", which is a number calculated as the time measured in the number of <b>seconds</b> since the Unix Epoch (January 1 1970 00:00:00 GMT). All programming languages have functions to convert timestamps to an human-readable format, but if you want to try by hand you can use one of the many <a href="https://www.epochconverter.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online converters</a>.</p>
<p><a id="pubapi-general-response-codes" name="pubapi-general-response-codes"></a></p>
<h6>HTTP Responses</h6>
<p>Response codes are used to tell your client about the state of the data you requests.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>200 =</code> "enjoy your JSON"</li>
<li><code>301 =</code> if the URL you requested is bad, but we know where it should be; your client should remember and correct this to use the new URL in future requests</li>
<li><code>304 =</code> if your client supports "<code>ETag/If-None-Match</code>" or "<code>Last-Modified/If-Modified-Since</code>" caching headers and the data have not changed since the last request</li>
<li><code>404 =</code> we try to tell you if the URL is malformed or the data requested is just not available (e.g., a username for a user that does not exist)</li>
<li><code>410 =</code> we know for certain that no data will ever be available at the URL you requested; your client should not request this URL again</li>
<li><code>429 =</code> we are refusing to interpret your request due to rate limits; see "<a href="#pubapi-general-rate-limits">Rate Limiting</a>" above</li>
</ul>
<p><a id="pubapi-general-jsonld" name="pubapi-general-jsonld"></a></p>
<h6>JSON-LD</h6>
<p>We provide "linked data" contexts for each of our JSON data formats. JSON-LD can be parsed as regular JSON (it is fully compatible), but we also provide <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#interpreting-json-as-json-ld">an HTTP header called "<code>Link</code>"</a> which contains a URL to the JSON-LD context for this data format. This helps the data describe its own meaning. You can read more about <a href="https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/">JSON-LD by reading the spec</a> or searching Google in your language.</p>
<p><a id="pubapi-general-jsonp" name="pubapi-general-jsonp"></a></p>
<h6>JSONP</h6>
<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP">JSONP, or "JSON with padding,"</a> a "<code>callback</code>" parameter can be sent in the query string of any URL, and the value will be treated as the name of a function to call with the data as a parameter. This is useful if you want to point to the URL in a &lt;script&gt; tag's src value, instead of calling the URL programmatically in your code. As an example, compare these:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://api.chess.com/pub/player/erik">https://api.chess.com/pub/player/erik</a></li>
<li><a href="https://api.chess.com/pub/player/erik?callback=myJavascriptFunction">https://api.chess.com/pub/player/erik?callback=myJavascriptFunction</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a id="pubapi-general-caching" name="pubapi-general-caching"></a></p>
<h6>Caching</h6>
<p>Each response has "<code>ETag</code>" and "<code>Last-Modified</code>" headers. If your client supplies the proper header in the request to prove that the data have not changed since your previous request ("<code>If-None-Match</code>" and "<code>If-Modified-Since</code>", respectively), then you will receive a <code>304 Not Modified</code> response code, telling you that it is safe and correct to use your cached version.</p>
<p>If you make a request more frequently than the "<code>Cache-Control</code>" header's "max-age" value, then our CDN may respond to you directly with cached values. At refresh rates greater than specified in the "max-age" value, the CDN will validate the currency of its response before sending it to you. You may see headers indicating a cache "HIT", "MISS", "EXPIRED", or "REVALIDATED" for this purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> The endpoints refresh at most once every 24 hours, if not noted otherwise.</p>
<p><a id="pubapi-general-caching" name="pubapi-general-gzip"></a></p>
<h6>HTTP Compression &amp; HTTP/2</h6>
<p>If the request is made with an "<code>Accept-Encoding: gzip</code>" header, then the response will be gzip compressed for transfer if it is of a size where this saves time (generally, more than 200 bytes). With gzip'd transfers, you can save up to 80% of the download bandwidth for the same data.</p>
<p>HTTP/2 requests will get HTTP/2 responses. For the most part, this means header compression / binary transfer, and multiplexed responses for parallel downloads. However, see <a href="#pubapi-general-rate-limits">above-mentioned rate limits on parallel requests</a>.</p>

<h3>Endpoints</h3>
<p><a id="pubapi-endpoint-player" name="pubapi-endpoint-player"></a></p>
<h6>Player Profile</h6>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Get additional details about a player in a game. <br /><strong>URL pattern:</strong> <a href="https://api.chess.com/pub/player/">https://api.chess.com/pub/player/</a>{username} <br /><strong>Data format:</strong></p>
<pre>{
  "@id": "URL", // the location of this profile (always self-referencing)
  "url": "URL", // the chess.com user's profile page (the username is displayed with the original letter case)
  "username": "string", // the username of this player
  "player_id": 41, // the non-changing Chess.com ID of this player
  "title": "string", // (optional) abbreviation of chess title, if any
  "status": "string", // account status: closed, closed:fair_play_violations, basic, premium, mod, staff
  "name": "string", // (optional) the personal first and last name
  "avatar": "URL", // (optional) URL of a 200x200 image
  "location": "string", // (optional) the city or location
  "country": "URL", // API location of this player's country's profile
  "joined": 1178556600, // timestamp of registration on Chess.com
  "last_online": 1500661803, // timestamp of the most recent login
  "followers": 17 // the number of players tracking this player's activity
  "is_streamer": "boolean", //if the member is a Chess.com streamer
  "twitch_url": "Twitch.tv URL",
  "fide": "integer" // FIDE rating
}
</pre>
<p><strong>JSON-LD Context:</strong> <a href="https://api.chess.com/context/Player.jsonld">https://api.chess.com/context/Player.jsonld</a> <br /><strong>Example:</strong> <a href="https://api.chess.com/pub/player/erik">https://api.chess.com/pub/player/erik</a></p>
<p><em>Note: the "player_id" is provided as a convenience to determine when a username has been changed. If you retrieve a Player Profile by the username-based URL linked from a Game or other object, and this new Player Profile has a "player_id" that matches a Profile you previously downloaded, then you can safely assume that this new Profile replaces the old, and all URLs with the previous username will now be found under the new username. This should be an extremely rare occurrence. This "player_id" will never change for a given account, however the future availability of this ID is not guaranteed.</em></p>
<p><a id="pubapi-endpoint-titled" name="pubapi-endpoint-titled"></a></p>
<h6>Titled Players</h6>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> List of titled-player usernames. <br /><strong>URL pattern:</strong> <a href="https://api.chess.com/pub/titled/">https://api.chess.com/pub/titled/</a>{title-abbrev}</p>
<p>Valid title abbreviations are: GM, WGM, IM, WIM, FM, WFM, NM, WNM, CM, WCM.</p>
<p><strong>Data Format:</strong></p>
<pre>{
  "players": [
    /* array of usernames for players with this title */
  ]
}
</pre>
<p><strong>JSON-LD contexts:</strong> <a href="https://api.chess.com/context/Players.jsonld">https://api.chess.com/context/Players.jsonld</a></p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <a href="https://api.chess.com/pub/titled/GM">https://api.chess.com/pub/titled/GM</a></p>
<p><a id="pubapi-endpoint-player-stats" name="pubapi-endpoint-player-stats"></a></p>
<h6>Player Stats</h6>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Get ratings, win/loss, and other stats about a player's game play, tactics, lessons and Puzzle Rush score. <br /><strong>URL pattern:</strong> <a href="https://api.chess.com/pub/player/">https://api.chess.com/pub/player/</a>{username}/stats</p>
<p>The response contains many "stats objects," each identified by the ratings-type from the game, composed of the rules code, an underscore, and the time-class code. If a person has not played a particular game type, no stats object will be present for it. Like so:</p>
<pre>{
  "chess_daily": {
    /* stats object for games of rules "chess" and "daily" time-class */
  },
  "chess960_daily": {
    /* stats object for games of rules "chess960" and "daily" time-class */
  },
  "chess_blitz": {
    /* stats object for games of rules "chess" and "blitz" time-class */
  },
  "tactics": {
      "highest": {
          "rating": "integer",
          "date": "timestamp"
      },
      "lowest": {
          "rating": "integer",
          "date": "timestamp"
      }
  },
  "lessons":{
      "highest": {
          "rating": "integer",
          "date": "timestamp"
      },
      "lowest": {
          "rating": "integer",
          "date": "timestamp"
      }
  },
  "puzzle_rush": {
      "daily":{ 
          "total_attempts": "integer",
          "score": "integer"
       },
      "best": {
          "total_attempts": "integer",
          "score": "integer"
       }
   }
}
</pre>
<p>Each stats object will contain only information that has been collected and is not "default". For example, if a player has not won any games in a game type, the "best" stats will not be present; if they have not played in tournaments, then the tournaments stats will not be present. Not all stats are collected for all game types, and the available data may change from time to time as we gather more information. Tactics, Lessons and Puzzle Rush stats may be missing, depending on player activity.</p>
<p><strong>Data Format, each Game-Type:</strong></p>
<pre>{
  "last": { // the current stats
    "date": 1509709165, // timestamp of the last rated game finished
    "rating": 1642, // most-recent rating
    "rd": 58 // the Glicko "RD" value used to calculate ratings changes
  },
  "best": { // the best rating achieved by a win
    "date": 1256228875, // timestamp of the best-win game
    "rating": 2065, // highest rating achieved
    "game": "URL" // URL of the best-win game
  },
  "record": { // summary of all games played

    "loss": 124, // number of games lost
    "draw": 21,  // number of games drawn
    "time_per_move": 18799, // integer number of seconds per average move
    "timeout_percent": 9.99 // timeout percentage in the last 90 days
  },
  "tournament": { // summary of tournaments participated in
    "count": 20,   // number of tournaments joined

<h6>Player Games</h6>
<p>There are five endpoints for a player's games: to-move, current, list of available monthly archives, monthly archive, and downloadable-PGN monthly archive. The to-move, current games, and monthly archive lists use this wrapping data format:</p>
<pre>{
  "games": [
    /* array of Game objects in ascending game-end-time order */
  ]
}
</pre>
<p>If no games were played that period (that month, or "now"), this is an empty array.</p>
<p>These game objects share these element definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pgn</code>: the PGN representation of the game.</li>
<li><code>rules</code>: to indicate chess-variant play. Possible values are: "chess", "chess960", "bughouse", "kingofthehill", "threecheck", "crazyhouse"</li>
<li><code>time_class</code>: ratings-group speed of the game. Possible values are: "daily", "rapid", "blitz", "bullet".</li>
<li><code>time_control</code>: specific time control used in the game, in <a href="http://www.saremba.de/chessgml/standards/pgn/pgn-complete.htm#c9.6">the PGN standard notation</a>.</li>
<li><code>last_activity</code>: in currently-playing (daily) games, this timestamp represents the time of the last action affecting the game. This may be a move, draw offer, or even a deactivation of the chat window. Omitted in archives, where it is synonymous with the <code>end_time</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><a id="pubapi-endpoint-games-current" name="pubapi-endpoint-games-current"></a></p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> Array of Daily Chess games where it is the player's turn to act. <br /><strong>URL pattern:</strong> <a href="https://api.chess.com/pub/player/">https://api.chess.com/pub/player/</a>{username}/games/to-move</p>
<p><strong>Data Format:</strong></p>

      "url": "string", // URL of this game
      "move_by": 1254438881, // timestamp of the when the move must be made by

<p><strong>Note:</strong> this list will at times include some games where it is not the player's turn, if a draw offer has been made. In these cases, the <code>move_by</code> value is "0", and the game is sorted to the top to represent possible immediate action before the other player moves. Sorting is normally based on how soon a move must be made by.</p>

<h6>Countries</h6>
<p>All country-based URLs use the country's 2-character ISO 3166 code (capitalized) to specify which country you want data for. <br /><a href="https://api.chess.com/pub/country/">https://api.chess.com/pub/country/</a>{iso} <br /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2</a></p>
<p>Chess.com supports players and clubs identifying with some regions that are not recognized countries in this ISO list. These countries are identified with codes within the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#User-assigned_code_elements">user-assigned code</a>" ranges. When possible, we tried to use codes that are commonly used in other applications. This is a list of these codes at Chess.com:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>XA</code> : "Canary Islands"</li>
<li><code>XB</code> : "Basque Country"</li>
<li><code>XC</code> : "Catalonia"</li>
<li><code>XE</code> : "England"</li>
<li><code>XG</code> : "Galicia"</li>
<li><code>XK</code> : "Kosovo"</li>
<li><code>XP</code> : "Palestine"</li>
<li><code>XS</code> : "Scotland"</li>
<li><code>XW</code> : "Wales"</li>
<li><code>XX</code> : "International"</li>
</ul>
<p>The presence or absence of any region on this list does not reflect any political opinion by Chess.com.
